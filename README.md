## How to add the bot to your server

1. [Add the bot to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=340416036610244609&scope=bot&permissions=35840)
2. Confgure the bot by running the !setip command
 * Arguments for setip are IP:PORT
 * Note that the port number here is +2 on your actual game server. So If your players join on port 1232, you use port 1234 here.
 * Example: !setip 12.34.56.78:1234
3. That's it! The bot should be running on your server and listening to commands.
